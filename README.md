# PicoMod
PicoMod is an RP2040-based compute module with high density connectors allowing for its small 20mmx20mm form-factor.

# PicoMod Breakout
This is a breakout for PicoMod to allowing use on a standard breadboard.

# PicoMod Eject
Eject is the evolution of [Lyra](https://github.com/The_Faulty/Lyra) maintaining Lyra's small size while greatly improving the power and sensing abilities. Not only can eject ignite an e-match at apogee, it also contains a 9-DOF sensor suite and two servo outputs enabling TVC (thrust vector control) usage.
